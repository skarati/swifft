This repository contains the new implementations of SWIFFT and generalized SWIFFT function using avx2 intrinsics.

To run the programs and verfy, one should go to the directory and run the shell script using the command
sh run.sh

swifft-8-avx2: contains the codes for 8-way parallelization
       bswifft-8-avx2: includes code for binary input, that is the traditional SWIFFT
       gswifft-8-avx2: includes code for inputs from $\mathbb{Z}_{257}^{1024}$

swifft-16-avx2: contains the codes for 16-way parallelization
       bswifft-16-avx2: includes code for binary input, that is the traditional SWIFFT
       gswifft-16-avx2: includes code for inputs from $\mathbb{Z}_{257}^{1024}$

Implementor: Sabyasachi Karati
